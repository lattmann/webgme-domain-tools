NOTE: This requires JModelica v1.12 to be installed at "C:\JModelica.org-1.12", and 'system' Python at "C:\Python27\python.exe"

1) Open a command window
2) run 'run_jmodelica_model_exchange.cmd' 
    - input/output plots should be generated for all FMUs

- All the necessary FMUs are here in the directory
- The model_exchange_config.json explains how they should be connected
- jmodelica_model_exchange.py reads the config file and runs 'explicit euler' model exchange simulation using JModelica
